# tic-tac-toe

I wrote this game to test a recursive search algorithem (Minimax) as a simple AI technic.

To play the game use the number keys 
I recomend to use the numeric keys section on the keyboard with Num Lock on.
Click ENTER after each number (i use getline()).
4 for left, 6 for right and so on..
click 5 and ENTER to place the mark.

Game can be played in different board sizes, required sequences and difficulty levels.

To play the classic varient live the constants as is (computer will never lose).

Another recomended varient:

BOARD_SIZE = 7

CONSEC_TO_WIN = 5

MAX_REC_DEPTH  = 5 // number of steps the computer will explore before deciding a move is safe

In this varient you will need to have 5 consecutive X / O to win

STARTING_PLAYER can either be PLAYER (you) or PC
